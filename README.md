# TVA (Training & Validation Authority)

**"For all types. Always."**

Welcome to the **Training & Validation Authority**. This repository serves as the designated containment zone for Research & Development, experimental validation, and high-variance testing for the **[Loom](https://github.com/openfluke/loom)** framework.

While Loom provides the pure, stable machinery for neural execution, the TVA exists to monitor the timeline of development, manage chaotic architectural variants, and prune the branches that fail to meet performance thresholds.

## 📂 Mission Protocol

The primary directive of this repository is to preserve the integrity of the "Sacred Codebase" (the main Loom repo) by isolating volatile experiments here.

This is a general R&D facility containing:

* **Variant Analysis:** Evolutionary algorithms that generate thousands of unique network topologies to see which ones survive.
* **Branch Pruning:** Neural pruning experiments where we strip away dead weight to find the efficient path.
* **Architectural Grafting:** "Frankenstein" experiments (Project Yggdrasil) where we stitch together disparate model species into a single functional entity.
* **Chaos Generators:** Stress tests designed to break the runtime and ensure stability across all dimensions (and tensor shapes).

## ⚡ Operational Structure

You will find various sub-directories here representing different "Timelines" of research. Some are destined to be integrated into the main framework; others will be pruned and sent to the Void.

* **/experiments**: One-off tests for new layer types (Gating, Switchboards, etc.).
* **/benchmarks**: Performance validation to ensure we aren't creating nexus events that crash the CPU.
* **/evolution**: Genetic algorithms and population training loops.
* **/integration**: The "End of Time" where successful experiments are prepped for merging into Loom.

## 🛠️ Protocol for Contributors

1. **Create a Branch:** Do not disrupt the flow of the main branch.
2. **Monitor Variance:** If your model's loss function diverges, it will be reset.
3. **Trust the Process:** We are not here to judge the code; we are here to validate its purpose.

If an architecture works, it is woven into the Tapestry. If it fails, it is pruned.
